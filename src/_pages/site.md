## Typography

The typography I use here is [Chaparral](https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/chaparral) by [Carol Twombly](https://fonts.adobe.com/designers/carol-twombly) and [Proxima Nova](https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/proxima-nova) by [Mark Simonson](https://fonts.adobe.com/designers/mark-simonson). The choice is typefaces was totally inspired by [Jason Santa Maria](https://jasonsantamaria.com/about/), an awesome designer who I've followed since the mid-2000's. His typography knowledge is nothing short of exquisite. ðŸ¤Œ Check out his work too.

## Design

The overall site design was done as collaboration between myself and User Experience Designer, [Daniel Maldonado](http://danielmdesigns.com). Daniel also designed my logo monogram which is ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥. Check out his work. He's a great designer and even greater human. 

The colors are from Tailwind's default palette. I am using a combination of Lime, Stone, and Rose. The Lime and Rose are a variation of green and red, so the complementary aspect translates over to create a unique feel. I chose Stone from the default palette because it was a warmer gray and I wanted to stick to same overall warm feeling.

## Technology

This site is powered by the beautiful and elegant programming language, [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) <img class="w-4 ml-1 inline-block align-text-top" src="{{ '/images/ruby.svg' | relative_url }}"/> . The creator [Yukihiro Matsumoto, a.k.a Matz](https://github.com/matz) designed and optimized the language for "programmer happiness", a concept founded on the belief that a programming language should be enjoyable to read and write for humans, not computers â€” and I totally agree. Ruby has been a pleasure to write in. This concept is further elaborated in a wonderful, unorthodox programming guide called [Why's Poignant Guide to Ruby](https://poignant.guide/). Give a read and enjoy some quirkiness and humor while learning how to code.

While Ruby is powering the site underneath, it is operating under [Bridgetown](https://bridgetownrb.com), a next-generation, progressive site generator & fullstack framework built by [Jared White](https://jaredwhite.com/). I call him the "Michelangelo" of programming because Bridgetown is a work of art and he's painting during a renaissance.

[TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com) <img class="inline-block w-6 align-text-top" src="{{ '/images/tailwindcss.svg' | relative_url }}"/> is my framework of choice. Using it is quite a paradigm shift, but I commend them for it. It is true that developers tend to create utility classes after some time. Some time after that I think everyone tries to create their own little CSS framework and that rarely gets very far with many. I appreciate how low-level Tailwind is with their classes. While I have respect for the other big frameworks before it, overriding styles had become a hassle and slow down the process of actually building an app. Tailwind is a cool tool with a fully-featured API to get you going on your next project.

## Deployment

My deployment method of choice is Git. I push to [GitHub](https://github.com) and from there it gets sent over to [Render](https://render.com) for hosting where it finds a home. Both services play really nicely with each other to create a nice seamless workflow for a smooth experience.

## Analytics

I have to give a shout out to an awesome service I use for tracking called [Fathom Analytics](https://usefathom.com). Make sure to check out their podcast [Above Board](https://usefathom.com/above-board) where they discuss privacy analytics, cats, and coffee. Jack and Paul are hilarious and knowledgeable.
