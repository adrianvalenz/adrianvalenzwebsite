Values can serve as a compass, especially when making difficult decisions. Having a set of values is important in any persons's life. Knowing what your values are can help you put fear aside when making a choice. If you know what is important to you — what you value, then your choice will be geared and centered toward preserving that value regardless of what you are afraid you might lose. 

After some time, you come to realize that consistently saying "yes" to your values helps you to say "no" to other not so meaningful opportunities. It can help you from being a "people-pleaser" and putting others before yourself so much that you forget to take care of yourself.

## Spirituality

Believing in something greater than we can comprehend is helpful for our health as it can give us peace. Whether or not you believe in God or a higher power, there are times where we will feel like things our just out of our control, and in those times, having faith that it is all going to work out is sometimes the best thing we can do. 

I value spirituality because it helps me shift my focus from myself toward the bigger picture.

## Family

We are not meant to do life alone. We are meant to have a tribe. People are happiest when they work together toward a common goal. You are not limited to one tribe either. You can have your family at home where you work with your partner to build a better life for yourselves. You can also have your music band jamming out together to spread out some of the dopest vibes people have ever felt. Maybe you have a start-up where you and your business partner share the dream to create a product that will help others. 

I value family because they are there to support you to achieve your goals, just as you'll be there for them.

## Love

I think the greatest thing we can have in this world is love, actually. Love for your family, your partner, and for yourself. Loving yourself is often overlooked. Too often people put others before themselves and it can become a slippery slope to enabling co-dependency or neglect for self. It's not selfish to take care of yourself first. 

Love yourself with everything you have; feed yourself the best food you can get, dress yourself in the best clothes you can get, learn a skill, exercise, do for yourself whatever brings you joy — then, only then if you have _any_ extra love left over, that is what you give away. Only when your cup runneth over. 

Some people are too caught up finding themselves while others out there creating themselves. The latter brings power back to you. You don't know who you are until you try that new thing.

How you love yourself creates a template for how you show love to others. You want to have the highest standards. If you want to give people your best, you have to be your best.

I value love because it can help create a better life for you and those around you.

## Communication

Communication is important because it shows you respect the person enough to respond, even when your response is something they may not want to hear. It doesn't even have to be that serious. We all get caught up with life and sometimes we can't get to a certain task or project as fast as we would like to, and that's ok. What's not ok is when you start dodging the person usually because of your own insecurities. If you can't get back to someone right away because you don't know how, owe it to yourself and them and work on the issue keeping you from speaking up.

## Empathy

It is really difficult to say whether empathy is a skill that we have to work on, or an innate response we have to others, regardless, it is super important to have. Being able to put yourself in the other person's shoes and attempt to understand what they are going through is a valuable skill that can help make their lives better because you will have better insight into what they need. Sure having empathy can help you out in business, but the real profit isn't always about money, but knowing you have the power to change someone's world.
