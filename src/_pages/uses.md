## Software

- [Kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/) is an awesome terminal. It's snappy, has support for ligatures, custom app icon, plethora of themes, and much more. Alacritty is a close second. iTerm2 is well-featured too but it would eat up my memory for some reason.
- [JetBrains Mono](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/) is my typeface. It's pretty dam sweet. It has ligatures, all the weights, I love the tall x-height, simple geometric shapes, and I appreciate the thought that went into designing their italics.
- [NeoVim](https://neovim.io/) convert here ‚Äî I've been a Vim user since 2013, and this year I finally got around to setting up NeoVim. Love how there is a community supporting it.
- [Tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki) + Vim commands are embedded into my fingertips. Helps me maintain a nice workflow.
- [TokyoNight](https://github.com/folke/tokyonight.nvim) has got to be one of the dopest themes I've come across a in a long time. So many features and while the colors seem loud at first, they actually are well balanced and carefully chosen. Great contrast in the "night" variant as well.
- [Procreate](https://procreate.art/) in combination with an Apple Pencil makes for the best digital painting experience I've had. I also like to sketch/paint here then move to Illustrator if creating a vector drawing.
- [Adobe Illustrator](https://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html) is my old friend. I've tried Affinity, it's great, but I'm too used to Ai and I like how it functions. Still use a mouse to draw vector points, I still find it easier to control the anchor points and nodes.
- [macOS Monterey version 12.2.1](https://www.apple.com/macos/monterey/) because I stay upgrading my Mac.

## Hardware

- [MacBook Pro](https://www.apple.com/macbook-pro-13/) with the (13-inch, 2020) 2 GHz Quad-Core Intel Core i5 and 16 GB RAM
- [Kindle Paperwhite 2021](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08KTZ8249/ref=fcatpage_shoveler_2?pf_rd_r=AWCHJJVT7P2GB058AQTZ&pf_rd_p=aec998c2-e5d0-4a88-a6d3-f9db08cffa62&pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_s=merchandised-search-2&pf_rd_t=30901&pf_rd_i=6669702011&ref=erdcatpage_desktop_m) has warm lighting feature now for night reading. Having a separate device to read is really nice.
- [iPad Pro](https://www.apple.com/ipad-pro/) with 12.9-inch screen and M1 chip üç™. Upgraded from 2018 iPad Pro 10-inch...so much space to draw on!

## Accessories

- [Apple Watch SE](https://www.apple.com/watch/) to keep track of my fitness goals. Eventually when life lets me I want to activate the cellular functionality and maybe retire the phone, just carry AirPods and a Watch. Hashtag minimalism.
- [iPhone 11 Pro Max](https://www.apple.com/iphone/) is the phone I was referring to ^^. 
- [Magic Mouse 2- Black](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MMMQ3AM/A/magic-mouse-black-multi-touch-surface)
- [Apple Pencil 2](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MU8F2AM/A/apple-pencil-2nd-generation?afid=p238%7CsYI7jAUdv-dc_mtid_1870765e38482_pcrid_467458887486_pgrid_76054338126_&cid=aos-us-kwgo-btb-applepencil--slid---product-)

## Languages (Programming & Verbal)

    - English
    - Spanish
    - Japanese (still learning)

## Personal

- [Moleskine Notebook](https://www.moleskine.com/en-us/shop/notebooks/the-original-notebook/classic-notebook-black-9788883701122.html) is my favorite for simple notes, journaling, and brainstorming. Even though we live in a digital age, we can't forget about the benefits of taking pen to paper. You can jot down ideas quicker than type. Using a pencil allows to quickly alternate between writing and drawing so one can better express their ideas. Some would argue for the iPad with Apple Pencil, but you need to charge it, and what's quicker than flipping through notebook pages?
